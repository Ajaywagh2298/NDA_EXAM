Why is it more complicated for small organizations ? Achieving a paperless office is possible, what is needed regardless of the size of the firm, it is administrative will, since it is necessary to reform administrative processes. 


Introduction:

The Paperless office concept is new and difficult to understand in a world that still uses paper as a support for multiple social, communications, advertising, financial, educational uses. This habit has prevailed in civilizations since paper has increased in recent decades. With the introduction and increased availability of ICT, far from reducing the use of paper it has soared in consumption. The impact of ICT is increasingly evident in the workplace, public or private setting, as they have automated most of their processes, achieving the improvement of procedures and products and services for customers, without significantly diminishing paper consumption. The causes are many and varied such as lack of new technologies, inappropriate use, the initial rejection of change, custom printing and the belief that a printed document is more valuable than a digital one, etc. 

Problem statement 

A paperless office is a workplace that has minimal paper-based processes and relies on digitized documents instead. Some organizations prefer the term “paper-light” as many offices and departments cannot completely eliminate paper files because of process or compliance requirements.Regardless, reducing the use of paper helps accelerate an organization’s digital transformation journey. This typically involves transitioning to an electronic document managing system that digitizes files and stores it in a central repository.
Despite pressures to be more competitive and the large investments that have been made in technology to improve the ability to create, process, update and distribute data, many of us, including local governments, are still drowning in a sea of paper that is becoming more difficult to control. Document and information control processes have not kept pace with the volumes of paper that we are creating. During the 2014s concerns were expressed that the growth of paperwork exceeded the corresponding growth in business and attempts were made to introduce digital documentation in order to create the paperless office, but they were never realized. Since then new technological developments like the Internet, with sharing and collaboration capabilities, have been introduced. 
Even if Intranet and Internet applications are available in the Ministry of Defence, the usability and success rate is very less and resistive. Departments always ask for ink signed hard copies. Most candidates' detailed verifications are done by hard copy of certificates and other documents required in departments as they don't rely on online verification.
While giving marks to the candidates, the officers have to use a hard copy of the marking sheet which afterwards has to combine all sheets and insert  the marks in files then to the database . Which is again a lengthy work and wastage of time as well as waste of paper. In some cases the hard copy can be misplaced by which data in the hard copy waished. We have to print more than 2 copies for giving marks, aur evaluating the candidates.
Please forward the most effective ways to motivate users to use online applications for better digital India (Recruitment process). Users of this system: All officers, computer users and candidates who apply.Technology that can help address the issue : All forms of digitization and computer technology to be used.
Securing and tracing documents
As awareness of identity theft and data breaches became more widespread, new laws and regulations were enacted, requiring companies that manage or store personally identifiable information to take proper care of those documents. Paperless office systems are easier to secure than traditional filing cabinets and can track individual accesses to each document.
